abstract: 'A four-dimensional analog of Chern–Simons theory produces integrable lattice models from Wilson lines and surface operators. We show that this theory describes a quasi-topological sector of maximally supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory in six dimensions, topologically twisted and subjected to an Ω-deformation. By realizing the six-dimensional theory in string theory and applying dualities, we unify various phenomena in which the eight-vertex model and the XYZ spin chain, as well as variants thereof, emerge from supersymmetric gauge theories.'

In this work with Kevin Costello, we provide a string theory explanation for various previously known phenomena in which the same family of quantum integrable systems, namely rational/trigonometric/elliptic 8-vertex models (or equivalently, XXX/XXZ/XYZ spin chains), appear from quantum field theory setups in different spacetime dimensions.
