abstract: 'Bosonic quantum field theories with holomorphic action functionals are realized by two types of constructions involving supersymmetric quantum field theories, compactified on an interval in one type and compactified on a disk and deformed in the other. We establish the equivalence between the two types of constructions by reducing the disk to the interval and the interval to a point. As examples, we discuss constructions of zero-dimensional gauged sigma model, gauged quantum mechanics, gauged symplectic bosons in two dimensions, and Chernâ€“Simons theory and its higher-dimensional variants.'
