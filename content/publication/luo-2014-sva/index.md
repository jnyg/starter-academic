abstract: 'We study Ω-deformation of B-twisted gauge theories in two dimensions. As an application, we construct an Ω-deformed, topologically twisted five-dimensional maximally supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory on the product of a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ and a three-manifold $M$, and show that when $\Sigma$ is a disk, this theory is equivalent to analytically continued Chern-Simons theory on $M$. Based on these results, we establish a correspondence between three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal theories and analytically continued Chern–Simons theory. Furthermore, we argue that there is a mirror symmetry between Ω-deformed two-dimensional theories.'
