abstract: 'A large class of supersymmetric quantum field theories, including all theories with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry in three dimensions and theories with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry in four dimensions, possess topological-holomorphic sectors. We formulate Poisson vertex algebras in such topological-holomorphic sectors and discuss some examples. For a four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory, the associated Poisson vertex algebra is the classical limit of a vertex algebra generated by a subset of local operators of the theory.'
