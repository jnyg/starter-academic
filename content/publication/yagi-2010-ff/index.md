abstract: 'Given a two-dimensional quantum field theory with $(0,2)$ supersymmetry, one can construct a chiral (or vertex) algebra. The chiral algebra of a $(0,2)$ supersymmetric sigma model is, perturbatively, the cohomology of a sheaf of chiral differential operators on a string Kähler manifold. However, it vanishes in some cases when instantons are taken into account. I will discuss the implication of this phenomenon for the Höhn–Stolz conjecture on the Witten genus.'
