abstract: 'We argue that the six-dimensional $(2,0)$ superconformal theory defined on $M \times C$, with $M$ being a four-manifold and $C$ a Riemann surface, can be twisted in a way that makes it topological on $M$ and holomorphic on $C$. Assuming the existence of such a twisted theory, we show that its chiral algebra contains a W-algebra when $M = \mathbb{R}^4$, possibly in the presence of a codimension-two defect operator supported on $\mathbb{R}^2 \times C \subset M \times C$. We expect this structure to survive the Î©-deformation.'
