abstract: 'We study the six-dimensional $(2,0)$ superconformal field theory on $S^1 \times S^2 \times M$ via compactification to five dimensions, where $M$ is a three-manifold. Twisted along $M$, the five-dimensional theory has a half of $\mathcal{N} = (2,2)$ supersymmetry on $S^2$, the other half being broken by a superpotential. We show that in the limit where $M$ is infinitely large, the twisted theory reduces to a three-dimensional topological quantum field theory which is closely related to Chernâ€“Simons theory for the complexified gauge group.'
