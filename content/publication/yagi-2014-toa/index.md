abstract: 'We formulate a deformation of Rozansky–Witten theory analogous to the Ω-deformation. It is applicable when the target space $X$ is hyperkähler and the spacetime is of the form $\mathcal{R} \times \Sigma$, with $\Sigma$ being a Riemann surface. In the case that $\Sigma$ is a disk, the Ω-deformed Rozansky–Witten theory quantizes a symplectic submanifold of $X$, thereby providing a new perspective on quantization. As applications, we elucidate two phenomena in four-dimensional gauge theory from this point of view. One is a correspondence between the Ω-deformation and quantization of integrable systems. The other concerns supersymmetric loop operators and quantization of the algebra of holomorphic functions on a hyperkähler manifold'
