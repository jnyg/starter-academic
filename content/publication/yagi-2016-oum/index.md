abstract: 'This is a brief review of my work on the correspondence between four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric field theories realized by brane tilings and two-dimensional integrable lattice models. I explain how to construct integrable lattice models from extended operators in partially topological quantum field theories, and elucidate the correspondence as an application of this construction.'
