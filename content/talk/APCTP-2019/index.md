summary:
abstract: I will explain how algebraic structures called Poisson vertex algebras arise from a large class of supersymmetric field theories. In the case of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories, the associated Poisson vertex algebras are the classical limits of vertex algebras which have drawn much attention in recent years. This is based on my work with Jihwan Oh.
